### Research Statement









Physical, chemical, and competative processes can influence the vertical distribution of phytoplankton in freshwater lakes. In dissolved organic carbon (DOC) rich waters, the photic zone may be limited to just a few meters below the surface. In subtropical oligotrophic Lake Annie (Highlands County, FL, USA), dissolved organic carbon quality and quantity may be a strong driver of phytoplankton assemblages spatially and temporally.

### Objectives

My goals in this workshop are to develop spatiotemporal species distribution models of dominant phytoplankton species in response to environmental drivers (i.e. DOC, temperature, nutrients). I hope to use the results of this project as a chapter of my masters' thesis.

### Hypotheses

1. Temporal Patterns: Species diversity and richness will be greatest and most variable in dark years (high DOC).
2. Vertical Patterns: Diversity and richness will be greatest in the epilimnion due to light and resource availability.

### Datasets

The datasets to be used in this project include a personal dataset of phytoplankton absolute abundance, DOC quality and quantity, bacterial abundance, dissolved oxygen, and temperature measured quartly (November 2018 - January 2020) from five depths (surface, 0m; chl-maximum, 2-4m; epilimnion, 6-9m; thermocline, 7-12m; and hypolimnion, 15m) from the central buoy of Lake Annie in Highlands County, FL. A second 14 year dataset of environmental parameters and phytoplankton net tows taken monthly from the center buoy at a depth of 10 meters (2006-2019) will be accessed with permission from Archbold Biological Station. These datasets will be publically available from the Archbold Biological Station data repository: https://www.archbold-station.org/html/datapub/data/data.html

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
